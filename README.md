# Terraform + Golang AWS Lambda + API Gateway

This is a minimal Hello World example of deploying an HTTP API backed by an AWS Lambda function. The function is written in Go and deployment is automated with Terraform.

## Prerequisites

### Terraform and Go

Install [Terraform][terraform] and [Go][golang]. On macOS with Homebrew:

```console
$ brew install go terraform
```

[terraform]: https://www.terraform.io/
[golang]: https://www.terraform.io/

### AWS credentials

Configure your AWS access key and secret key with the `aws configure` command, or just create a file `~/.aws/credentials` containing the keys:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = KEY
aws_secret_access_key = KEY
```

The access key ID and the secret access key can be generated in the AWS management console.

### AWS region

The environment variable `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` should be set to your favorite region. `us-east-1` would just work if you are not sure:

```console
$ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

This environment variable is used by the [Terraform AWS provider][terraform-aws].

## Usage

Run `make` to build and deploy an API:

```console
$ make
```

In the process Terraform will ask you for a confirmation, so type `yes`. Everything should finish in less than a minute! After this you can play with the API:

```console
$ curl -fsSL $(terraform output -raw url)?name=world
Hello, world!
$ curl -fsSL $(terraform output -raw url)?name=lambda
Hello, lambda!
```

Cleanup:

```console
$ make clean
```

### About the Makefile

The Makefile is for convenience and does nothing special. It just runs following commands for you:

```console
$ terraform init
$ go get .
$ GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o hello
$ zip hello.zip hello
$ terraform apply
$ terraform destroy
```
